In India, more than 150,000 people are killed each year in traffic accidents. Which in 2016
logged about 40,000. There is one death every 4 minutes due to a road accident in India. One
serious road accident in the country occurs every minute and 16 die on Indian roads every
hour. The first hour of such an emergency, called the “golden hour” is widely regarded as the
most precious time for saving lives. The 201 Law of Commission had stated, “Doctors point
out that at least 50% of fatalities can be averted if victims are admitted to a hospital within
the first one hour”. To reduce these types of casualties, many projects have been published.
The existing works which are published in various journals can prevent accidents, but in few
journals propose methods of reporting accidents to the nearby emergency unit using
automated systems having sensors. We are trying to alter the existing system from scratch
with a state-of-the-art Accident detection system using Artificial Intelligence.
In our proposed system, high resolution traffic cameras placed at specific angles detect the
accidents with the help of a special Algorithm. Classification of data is achieved using
machine learning algorithms to find the severity of the accident, crossing a predefined
threshold of probability compared with a pre-trained database. After finding the severity, it
transmits the alert notification to nearby emergency units such as ambulance, firefighters and
police. Through this project, we try to overcome the problem using the concept of Deep
Learning, and Artificial Intelligence.
